In more words but still under 200:

"Programmers today should remember the timeless advice from computer scientist Donald Knuth, emphasizing that 'Premature optimization can be the source of much complexity and bugs.' Instead, invest your time in crafting clear, readable, and maintainable code. This practice ensures better collaboration, easier debugging, and often, through structured design, it naturally yields acceptable or even optimal performance. Only after identifying bottlenecks via profiling should you target specific optimizations. Always prioritize readability and maintainability, as these aspects tend to have a profound impact on the longevity and efficiency of your software."

- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil' - Donald Knuth. Focus on writing clear, maintainable code first and optimize only when necessary, after profiling and identifying genuine bottlenecks." 

In more detail:
Optimization without a clear understanding of where performance issues truly lie can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain code. Before optimizing, ensure your code works correctly and is well-structured. Profiling tools can help identify parts of your program that are slow. Only then should you apply targeted optimizations to those specific areas. This principle reminds us that readability, simplicity, and maintainability should not be sacrificed for hypothetical performance gains.

- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil' — Donald Knuth. Focus on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code first. Optimize only when necessary and after profiling. Remember that clarity and simplicity often lead to better performance in the long run." 

This quote emphasizes that over-concern with optimizing code before it's needed can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain solutions. It's more important to have a correct, understandable implementation initially, as most programs spend far more time being read and modified than they do being written. Optimization should be data-driven and targeted at proven bottlenecks.

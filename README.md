- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. Invest time in planning and designing your program, use descriptive variable names, write modular and reusable functions, follow consistent coding conventions, and always comment your code. Remember, code is read more often than it is written, so make it easy for others (and your future self) to understand."

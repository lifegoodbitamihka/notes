- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. Invest time in planning and designing your program, use descriptive variable names, write modular and reusable functions, follow consistent coding conventions, and always comment your code. Remember, code is read more often than it is written, so make it easy for others (and your future self) to understand."

- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your work. Here are some tips to help with this:

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, it is important to determine which tasks are the most critical and should be completed first. By prioritizing your tasks in this way, you can ensure that you focus on the important aspects of the project and not get sidetracked by less critical tasks.
2. Plan ahead: By planning ahead for your projects, You can avoid last-minute panic and stress. Create a plan for each project that includes a timeline, list of tasks to complete, resources needed, etc. Then, stick to the plan as much as possible to ensure everything is completed on time. 
3. Stay organized: Keeping your workspace and code organized is crucial for efficiency and productivity. Use version control systems like Git to track your code changes, organize your files and folders, use code editors with built-in functionality like auto-completion and debugging tools. These features can save you time and make your coding experience more enjoyable.

- Today's programming wisdom is to "write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend." This means that instead of trying to anticipate all possible future requirements and building in flexibility from the start, it's often better to write simple, straightforward code that can be easily replaced or modified when those requirements inevitably change. This approach can save time and reduce complexity, making it easier to maintain and evolve your codebase over time.
